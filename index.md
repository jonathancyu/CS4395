## Welcome to my portfolio
I'm a computer science student at UT Dallas! I love to read, cook, play video games, and a whole lot of other stuff.

## Portfolio Objective
This portfolio highlights work done for the [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/kjmazidi/NLP/blob/gh-pages/index.md) class at UTD with Professor Karen Mazidi. 

## Portfolio Contents
1. [Overview of NLP](https://jonathancyu.github.io/Component0/Overview%20of%20NLP.pdf)
2. [Python Warmup](https://jonathancyu.github.io/NLP-Portfolio/homework1/homework1_jcy180000.py)
	* This program imports data from a .csv file, and then validates the given info. If any values are not formatted correctly, the program prompts for a correct entry. The program then saves the data as a pickle file, then loads the same pickle file and prints the data.
	In order to run the program, enter 
	```python homework1_jcy180000.py data/data.csv```
	In my opinion, Python is incredibly powerful for text processing. However, Python is not built for optimal runtime thus text processing could be faster in some other languages. This can be said for any function or library of Python.
	This assignment was mostly review for me. One thing I learned is how powerful pickle files are. Initially, I thought they were simply json files under a different name, however I soon realized it's a way to save an object with all of its components, which is incredibly useful.
